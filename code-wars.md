# Bootcamp II ... Code Wars!

Part of growing as a programmer is to practice, practice, practice. Throughout this course, there will be daily Code Wars challenges.

The daily challenge will be posted at 12:00 p.m. every day and will be due by the following day at 8:59 a.m. Plan to focus on this task every day after class sometime between lunch and  p.m. and 2p.m.

### Whiteboarding

Try and rotate your new partner every day for whiteboarding.

Between 12pm and 1:30pm each day, get together with your partner and read through the daily challenge. There are several items to accomplish, as time allows:
  - Read through the challenge and make sure everyone understands what is being asked.
  - Pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. You can each take turns in this process, or select one person to do all the writing, but each team member **must** participate in the discussion. Pseudocode can be described as writing out your plan in human-readable form. For example, `set up a counter` or `multiply each value by 2`.
  - You should **not** be writing any actual code, only referencing Code Wars for the problem domain.
  - **Take a picture** of your whiteboard pseudocode solution. Make sure each team member has a copy of the picture. This will be included in your personal repo and is part of the individual assignment requirements for full points.
  - You may then continue to work with your partner or part ways to work independently. You should now move on to attempting to write the solution on Code Wars.
  - You'll know your solution is correct when all of the tests pass and turn green. Only then can you add your solution to your repo.

### GitHub repo

As part of today's assignment, create a new repository on GitHub to track your Code Wars solutions throughout 301. This repo should have a README.md file with an overview of the purpose of the repo.

Work on a new branch for each challenge. For example, for today's challenge you can make a new branch with the command `git checkout -b replace-all-dots`. When you finish the assignment each day, make a new pull request from your daily challenge branch to your master branch and submit the URL in Canvas.

Within your repo, you should create a separate folder for today's Code Wars challenge. As we progress throughout this course, you will be creating a new folder for each solution, so start off with an organized repo!

Each folder should have the name of the challenge. Within each folder, you should include the following:
  - README.md file with the description of the problem domain from Code Wars, a link to the challenge on Code Wars, and an overview of your process for solving the challenge.
  - Picture of your pseudocode from the whiteboarding exercise (except for the first individual assignment when you set up your repo)
  - JavaScript file of your solution *after confirming that it passes on Code Wars*. Your TAs will be confirming that your solution passes the tests, so make sure that it is complete before adding it to your repo. Besides, you wouldn't want a potential employer to see your broken code!
