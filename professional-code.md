Attention to detail

## Code

### Early Warning System

1. Linting - syntax and style
1. Code Spell Checker - typos

### Passes Lint

1. Indentation is perfect
1. Syntax is correct
1. Style is idiomatic

### Folder/File Organization

1. Logically organized
1. Consistent naming:
    1. Pick one for folders and files:
        * `kebob-case` or `camelCase`
    1. `README.md` is exceptional

## Process

Work incrementally while validating. Read that last sentence 10 times.

### Known Good State

1. Break things into small chunks
1. Write 1-3 lines **max**
1. Validate (check/test) that it worked
1. Commit

### Commit

1. Frequent commits
1. Strive for "why" (not "what")

## Pace

Above leads to good pace
